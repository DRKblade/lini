This is an instruction to use this project as a template for other projects. This involves:
- Removing source code specific to this project
- Modifying CMakeLists.txt files
- Modifying helper scripts
- Modifying the /contrib directory (for publishing to official repositories)
- Reinitialize .git


1. Removing unnecessary source code

1.1. All .hpp and .cpp files in /include, /src and /test may be removed.
However, these headers and its .cpp files provide general functionalities that you may need:
- format.hpp: Macros for unix terminal text formatting.
- error.hpp: Macros to quickly define runtime error
- logger.hpp: Logging utilities


2. Modifying CMakeLists.txt files

Location of CMakeLists.txt files:
There is one in the root directory and one in each source code directory.

In the CMakeLists.txt files:
"cscheme" is the name of the main target in CMakeLists.txt files
"scheme" is the name of the library target, which will be linked to cscheme

2.1. Replace all instances of "cscheme" and "scheme" with your own project names
2.2. If your main function is not in /src/main.cpp:
Change the 'add_executable' line in /src/CMakeLists.txt to specify the right path


3. Modifying helper scripts

In file /build.sh:
- usage() prints out available build options. Modify them to suit your project
- parse() parses command-line arguments into options
- ask() asks the user to fill in unspecified options regarding the call to cmake
- main() use the options to build the project

In file /archive.sh:
Put your project name in the proj_name variable
This file is used to generate archives of your project's git repository


4. Modifying the /contrib directory

/contrib contains files required to publish your project to an official repository
If you don't intent to do so, you can delete it.
Otherwise, refer to the Arch Linux wiki for instruction on how to prepare the files.
