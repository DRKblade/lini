# Code guidelines
As the project is still young. Here are some rough guidelines for the code:
* Code lines should not exceed 100 characters
* Comment lines may exceed 100 characters, even encouraged to do so.
It is encouraged for multi-line comments to be merged into a single line
so that the reader can show/hide comments by enabling/disabling word wrap.
* Opening pointy brackets `{` should stay on the pervious line,
unless the opening and closing brackets are on the same line
* If the first line of an function or class definition are to be split before the name,
the split must be right next to the name of the entity
